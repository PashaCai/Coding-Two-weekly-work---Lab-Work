# Coding-Two-weekly-work---Lab-Work
Two C++ &amp; Openframework and Two Python work

Both C++ assignments are in the corresponding folders and the demo videos are available in the library

Two python jobs are also in the library, 1_python_numpy.ipynb and 2_python_Transflow & GAN.ipynb. The exact results can be viewed directly on github by clicking on the code, 1 for processing images using Gaussian filtering and 2 for image style conversion.

The second python job has more image processing results in the master branch, which may not be previewed due to the large file size. The minimalist version can be viewed directly in this library.

All videos have been uploaded on PANOPTOï¼Œ You can also choose to watch it here
